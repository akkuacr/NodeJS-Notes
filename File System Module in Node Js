File System

Nodejs is a platform that uses Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine ,allowing devlopers to use Javascript to create server-side Applications that generate 
dynamic content for web clients
What sets node js apart are event driven and non-blocking I/o operations
NodeJS includes a built in module called FS(File System) that allows users to manage Files by creating,reading,deleting and performing other file operations
To use this module ,devlopers can call the "require()" method , which provides acess to POSIX functions Wrapped by Node.js to enable boht synchronous and asynchronous file system operations,depending on the user
requirements

var fs=require('fs');


Synchronous vs Asynchronous approach :

The Synchronous approach involves blocking functions that wait for each operation to complete before executing the next one.
This means that a command won't execute until the query has finished executing and all the results from previous commands have been obtained. 

On the other hand, the Asynchronous approach involves non-blocking functions that execute all operations at once, without waiting for each operation to complete. 
The results of each operation are handled when they become available, and each command is executed after the previous one. If the operations involve querying large amounts of data from a database, the Asynchronous approach is recommended.
